# FAT32 File System Utility
A simple, user-space, shell-like utility that is capable of interpreting a FAT32 file system image. The program understands basic commands to manipulate the given file system image and does not corrupt the file system image. Written in Java with good object-oriented programming (OOP) style.  

## Overview
_The following summaries were generated by ChatGPT and reviewed for accuracy_  

This Java project comprises multiple files working together to implement a FAT32 file system reader. The main class, `fat32_reader`, initializes the file, fields, and data structures like the File Allocation Table (FAT), root directory, and enters an interactive loop for user commands. The project is structured with classes for representing fields, directory entries, directories, and encapsulating file system functionalities. `Field` encapsulates information about specific fields in the FAT32 structure, and `DirEntry` represents directory entries. The `Dir` class manages directory-related operations, and methods in the `fat32_reader` class implement commands like changing directories, reading files, and displaying information. The project provides a command-line interface for users to navigate, explore, and interact with the contents of a FAT32 file system.

Users can interact with the FAT32 file system reader command-line utility by providing the path to a FAT32 file system image as a command-line argument. Here's an example of how a user might interact with the utility:

**Run the Program:**
   ```bash
   java fat32_reader /path/to/fat32_image.img
   ```

**Navigate and Explore:**
   - View current directory contents:
     ```
     /] ls
     ```

   - Change directory:
     ```
     /] cd directory_name
     ```

   - View information about the file system:
     ```
     /] info
     ```

   - Display information about a specific file or directory:
     ```
     /] stat file_or_directory_name
     ```

   - Read contents of a file at a specified offset and number of bytes:
     ```
     /] read file_name offset num_bytes
     ```

   - Display the size of a file:
     ```
     /] size file_name
     ```

   - Terminate the program:
     ```
     /] stop
     ```
  
## Quickstart
